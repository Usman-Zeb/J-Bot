While completing the complaint header agent would ask customer the details shared by him with fraudster (OTP is one them) and would input accordingly.
As mention above, yes case would be locked in fraud execution TAB as customer become victim of social engineering.
Yes complaint would be locked once customer call helpline to report his grievance about unauthorized deduction from his account either through merchant payments of any other means. In case customer just calls helpline for information prospective no complaint would be locked in that scenario.
              For case where customer did not received any fake call or case where customer is unable to share the number of fraud caller details it would be mentioned as “Nil”
Yes complaint would be locked and caller number/ customer number who received call and sender amount via agent would be mentioned as victim.
In case customer does not have Jazz cash account & is OMNO customer & amount is sent via agent complaint would be locked. We believe in that case we could not have L3 verification. Please comment if we have it through any other means.

When offering UPSELL, it is essential to log the UPSELL Offered work code in Upsell portal alongside the relevant query work code in Ayava (this will be developed later)
Incase customer is annoyed due to any issue or complaint then we should not offer UPSELL and handle customer as per the current SOP
In case of a network complaint call, we will offer UPSELL only if customers’ complaint has been forwarded and/or customer sounds satisfied
If call is dropped during the conversation and UPSELL cannot be offered completely (undecided) then we will neither update records in portal nor punch upsell work code in Avaya
If customer interrupts during the UPSELL offering then we should not continue the UPSELL offering, means we cannot insist customers in such scenarios
Calling from same number (Same CLI) is mandatory for Upsell
If customer is asking about eligibility confirmation for other account numbers then we will politely guide that it can be confirmed once call is landed from same CLI
Upsell will not be offered if a number is blocked on any blocking reason (Block on Stolen, Fraud, PTA, Spammers, UAO_668 etc.) and call is received from same CLI. If restoration is processed during the call and number is activated, upsell can be offered

15985,SMS Outgoing-ROX,In case customer complaints for SMS Outgoing issue then we will follow below guidelines. Handling also includes SMS spamming restoration," For complaints where customer claims  that they are successfully sending SMS but SMS is not received party B end. Scenario 1:  It has been observed that when customers are using American handsets and after updating of software, it adds 11 before number. In this case SMS is successfully sent (also visible in Usage ) but not received at  party B end. If customer confirms  such a case where customer’s handset is appending “11” as prefix, ask customer to check if “11” is being appended only when customer sends message to B-Party who’s number is saved in his/her contact list or when he/she manually types the B-Party number for SMS.  Remedy:  If error is true where customer is sending message to saved list then guide customer to re-build his/her contact list . Second remedy is to ask customer to factory reset handset or downgrade its software for issue resolution.                 Important: “Please ensure that re-building of contact list is always guided before asking customer to downgrade handsets Software”.  Common Example of American handsets are;        (Motorola XT1585/Motorola Droid Turbo 2, Motorola KF12937145/Motorola XT1662/Motorola Moto M, Motorola XT1254/Motorola XT1250 etc)  
For complaints where customer claims  that they are successfully sending SMS but SMS is not received party B end.
Scenario 1:
Remedy:
               Important: “Please ensure that re-building of contact list is always guided before asking customer to downgrade handsets Software”.
      (Motorola XT1585/Motorola Droid Turbo 2, Motorola KF12937145/Motorola XT1662/Motorola Moto M, Motorola XT1254/Motorola XT1250 etc) 
 Scenario 2:  In case customer claims sending SMS but it’s not received at party B end,  there is a possibility of improper Service Center Number saved in customer’s handset;  this error can be modified after software/firmware upgrade. However, in case where Service Center Number is not properly saved, It is observed that there will be no record/CDR  generated due to invalid SC-number where no message is submitted to SMSC.  Remedy:  In this case please guide customer to modify the Service Center Number to “92300000042” or simply “92300” by checking through the settings of its default messaging App in handset.  
Scenario 2:
Remedy:
 Scenario 3:  There are situations where outgoing SMS issue is related to Anti-spamming policy which can be handled upfront by frontend agents with proper probing. It has been observed that customers are complaining about outgoing SMS issue, when customers are sending same text/content on different numbers which exceeds allowed Limits on Jazz network. Example:  “Good Morning” send to 400 contacts in 15 mins, this is spamming.  Remedy:  If customer message exceed the limit, message will reject by anti-spam.        Number of Messages   Duration     50 Messages of same content   Per hour     200 Messages   Per 15 Minutes.     1000 Messages   Per hour     3000 Messages   Per Day

·         After successfully linking or creating Payoneer account, customer can receive funds in JazzCash account through Payoneer.
·         At the time of registration of new Payoneer account or linking with JazzCash application, customer needs IBAN Number. The system generated IBAN at the time of registration, which you should verify to make sure it is “PK29JAZZ0000000000000001”. This has nothing to do with your mobile account number and is just a system level code.
·         There are two IDs for the transaction one is the Payoneer transaction ID and the other is the receipt number, for tracking the complaints we need receipt number. Customer goes to “Manage account”, taps “transaction history” where all past transactions are mentioned.
·         The IBAN is a JazzCash and Payoneer mutually agreed IBAN code which makes sure your JazzCash mobile account, which is being used for registration, is linked with your new Payoneer Account.

·         Freelancers mostly work on marketplaces i.e. Upwork/fiver etc. where they must pay 10% & 20% fees on the payments they receive from their clients. Through Payoneer Billing Service they can now send a payment request to their clients directly and avoid fees charged by the marketplaces.

·         Customer will login JazzCash app and link Payoneer account (if not linked) and would be able to use service from homepage by clicking “Request a Payment”.

·         As per current SBP directions, currently only one mobile number/ RAAST ID can be linked with one bank account therefore if a customer would already have their RAAST ID linked with HBL, they would have to de-link their RAAST ID from HBL to be able to link their RAAST ID to their JazzCash account to receive funds via RAAST through JazzCash
·         When a customer would be sending funds via RAAST to a recipient and the recipient would not have a JazzCash account but a RAAST ID already linked with another bank, funds would be sent to the recipients RAAST ID which would be linked to their bank account
·         For performing transaction via RAAST customer firstly need to link RAAST ID with specific account
·         For JazzCash RAAST ID should be linked with account for successfully receiving transaction via RAAST
·         If RAAST ID is linked with account customer will not be able to perform Change of MSISDN for Change of MSISDN RAAST ID should de-linked.
·         There are two type of RAAST transaction
Incoming IBFT:
·         This Transaction includes all transactions which is sent from bank account to JazzCash account via RAAST
·         Customer calls on helpline that amount is sent from any bank via RAAST but not received in JazzCash account inform customer to register complaint at Sender Bank.
Outgoing IBFT:
Following standard Purpose of Transfer values have been added while performing Raast transaction.
·         Via RAAST transaction are performed in real-time

·         Agent will check the system if transaction is completed and transaction completion time is less than 24 hours, agent will inform customer to wait for 24 hours

§  Service Fee = 0.50% of Cash in Amount = 5 Rs.
§  FED = 16% of Service Fee = 16% of 5 Rs. = 0.65
§  Total Cash in charge = service fee + FED = 5 + 0.65 = 5.65
·         Example for amount greater than 20,001 to above
·         Cash in Amount = 30,000
§  Service Fee = Flat Rs. 100
§  FED = 13 % of Service Fee = 13% of 100 Rs.
